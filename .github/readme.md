# Reboot required

This program checks for a need to reboot on Ubuntu and Red Hat-based systems. If there are any updates applied for the kernel, it lets you know if a reboot is required.

By default it only tells you if a reboot is required or not. The verbose mode displays all packages causing the required reboot.
